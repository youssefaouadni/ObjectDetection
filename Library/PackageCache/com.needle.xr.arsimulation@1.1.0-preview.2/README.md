## What is this?
  
This package allows you to fly around in the Editor and test your AR app, without having to change any code or structure. Iterate faster, test out more ideas, build better apps.  
ARSimulation is a custom XR backend, built on top of the [XR plugin architecture](https://blogs.unity3d.com/2020/01/24/unity-xr-platform-updates/).
